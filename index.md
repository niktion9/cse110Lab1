A very important thing to know about me is that I just **love** food.
Here are my top three favorite ice-cream flavors:
1. Chocolate
2. Mint-Chip
3. Cookie Butter
here is what cookie butter ice-cream looks like:

It's not like I just eact unhealthy foods. I also like my fruits and veggies a lot as well. My favorite snack is grapes, also know as *vitis vinifera*
Apart from food, a big aspect of my personality is being student. The only thing that is keeping me going Abe Lincoln's quote: 
> The best way to predict your future is to create it.

### Me as a programmer
As a programmer, when dealing with teh terminal I have a couple favorite commands, which are:
```
rm
rmdir
cat
```
I like ```rn``` and ```rmdir``` because I often commit small mistakes like double clones or create a directory or a file in the wrong place. 
I also like ```cat``` because I often find vim a little bit fo hassle and even overwhelming at time, as I feel like it takes me away from the terminal. That's why I use ```cat``` so that the text is displayed right there and I can select text rather than worryign about accidentally changes the work.
This is my favorite webpage to use when I am stuck with syntax: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arraylist.asp).
Also here is the [README](README.md) file that I created for this lab. I am currently learn about how helpful README files can be and how important documentaion is for every implementation.
here are the languages I have experience with:
- Java
- Python
- C/C++
here is my task list, as a CS major:
- [x] 110 quiz
- [ ] 110 lab
- [ ] cogs 108 lab
